Summary. This note records the precise, falsifiable slope prediction for a co-located cavity–
atom redshift comparison across a vertical geopotential difference. Using the sector-resolved
formalism defined in my LPI letter, the measurable ratio slope

band, with leading value

(DFD, nondispersive band).

General Relativity (GR) corresponds to ξ = 0 in Eq. (1), hence a strict null for the cotransported ratio.1

via an over-determined 4 → 3 GLS solution with full covariance [1].

DFD leading-order prediction
In DFD’s optical-metric sector, photons propagate with phase velocity vphase = c/n = c e−ψ
(nondispersive band ), so an evacuated cavity tracks n = eψ to leading order, while the co-located
atomic transition is leading-order ψ-insensitive in this sector. Therefore,
αw → 1,

αL

αat → 0 ⇒ ξ (M,S) → +1,

giving Eq. (2). This yields an order-∆Φ/c2 geometry-locked slope: |∆R/R| ∼ ∆Φ/c2 ≈ 1.1 ×
10−14 per 100 m on Earth.

Correction controls (as implemented in the protocol)
The LPI protocol specifies explicit controls so that any allowed deviations enter Eq. (2) only
through small, bounded ε-terms:
• Dispersion/thermo-optic bound via dual-wavelength probing within the low-loss band,
requiring |ξλ1 − ξλ2 | < 0.1 |ξ|targ (and < 2σ∆ ), which caps |εdisp | at ≲ 10% of a per-slope
target and ≲ 2% in the GLS solution [2].
• Elastic sag / orientation flip modeling plus 180◦ flips at each height distinguish
mechanical-length artifacts (sign-reversing) from genuine redshift (sign-preserving), bounding |εsag | at ≲ 10−16 per window [3].
• Environmental thresholds / hardware swaps (vibration, temperature, pressure,
magnetic reversals; mirror and electronics swaps) encode residual configuration offsets
in the covariance, further suppressing bias [4].

Numerical statement to be compared with data
For a vertical separation ∆h measured geodetically (beyond g∆h),
∆R
g ∆h
= (1 ± 0.1disp ± 0.02GLS ) 2 + O(10−16 ) ,
R DFD, ULE/Sr

where the ± terms reflect the protocol’s internal dispersion/GLS bounds when the dual-λ and
stationarity criteria are satisfied [2, 4]. GR predicts zero for the same co-transported ratio.

Falsification
A result consistent with ξ = 0 at or below |∆Φ|/c2 after applying the above controls would
falsify the nondispersive-band DFD prediction stated here.
