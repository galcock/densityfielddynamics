Geometric Cancellation of Cavity–Atom LPI Signals

Abstract

construction, the vacuum constitutive relations:
εeff = ε0 e+ψ ,

We prove that in Density Field Dynamics (DFD),
the tree-level response of electromagnetic cavity resonances and atomic transition frequencies to the scalar
field ψ cancel in their ratio, reducing the measurable
Local Position Invariance (LPI) violation parameter
from ξLPI ∼ 1 to ξLPI = kαeff · ∆S α ∼ 10−5 . Three independent empirical checks confirm this cancellation.
The BACON optical clock network (Nature 591, 564,
2021) further constrains the screening regime, requiring that kαeff be evaluated at the local gravitational
environment rather than the source field. This erratum strengthens the theory’s consistency with all
existing clock data while preserving the ROCIT 13.5σ
detection as the primary experimental signature.

The spacer is an electromagnetic solid: its lattice constant is set by the Bohr radius, so L ∝ a0 (ψ) ∝ e+ψ .
The local light speed is clocal = c e−ψ . Therefore:

The Physical Residual

δR/R = 0.25×6.0×10−7 ×1.65×10−10 = 2.5×10−17 .
(15)
This is comparable to the BACON between-day variability (ξYb/Sr = 10.8 × 10−18 , χ2red = 6.0) and therefore consistent with the data.
Conclusion: Screening must be evaluated at the
local gravitational environment, not at the source of
the perturbation. Physically, the Unruh–de Sitter
mechanism depends on the total local |∇ψ|, which at
Earth’s surface is dominated by Earth’s own field.

WEP is broken at one loop by Unruh–de Sitter
screening of quantum fluctuations. The screened effective coupling is:

kαeff (a) = 2 α µLPI (a/a0 ),

2. ROCIT detection preserved: The 13.5σ
ion–neutral modulation uses a different channel (cavity–atom with ionic transition) where
∆S α ∼ 6, giving signals at ∼ 10−5 —unaffected
by this revision.
3. Nuclear clocks become paramount: With
α ≈ 5900 (Beeks et al. 2025), the Th-229/Sr
STh
annual signal from α-coupling alone is:
δR/R ≈ 6×10−7 ×5900×1.65×10−10 ≈ 5.8×10−13 ,
(16)
detectable at current nuclear clock precision (∼
10−12 ).
4. Height tests require space: The heightseparated test needs ∼ 10−20 precision for ∆h =
100 m, pushing it to future space missions.
5. Theory becomes cleaner: The “why hasn’t
anyone noticed 10−10 drift?” problem disappears. All existing null results are naturally explained.

Summary

The optical metric ds̃2 = −c2 e−2ψ dt2 + dx2 uniquely
determines constitutive relations ε = ε0 eψ , µ = µ0 eψ .
These modify the Coulomb potential, causing cavity
spacers to expand by e+ψ while light slows by e−ψ .
The compound effect gives fcav ∝ e−2ψ , identical to
the atomic scaling, so the ratio is constant at tree
level.
The physical LPI violation is a one-loop quantum
correction, screened by the local gravitational environment to kαeff ∼ 10−7 at Earth’s surface. Three independent empirical checks confirm this picture. The
nuclear clock transition in 229 Th, with S α ≈ 5900,
amplifies this residual to ∼ 10−13 —within reach of
current experimental programs.
