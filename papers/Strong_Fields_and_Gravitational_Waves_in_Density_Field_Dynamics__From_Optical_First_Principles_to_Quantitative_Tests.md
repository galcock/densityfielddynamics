Strong Fields and Gravitational Waves in Density Field Dynamics:
From Optical First Principles to Quantitative Tests
Gary Alcock1

(Dated: September 8, 2025)

Density Field Dynamics (DFD) posits a single scalar field ψ(x, t) on Euclidean R3 such that
2
massive test bodies experience a = c2 ∇ψ and photons propagate with refractive index n = eψ
(one-way c1 = c/n). Weak-field optics are matched to GR’s classic tests by normalization. We
answer three outstanding critiques: principle, strong field, and radiation. (i) We formulate a
Minimal Optical Equivalence principle: light follows the eikonal of an effective optical metric
ds̃2 = −c2 dt2 /n2 (x, t) + dx2 , while matter sees the conservative potential Φ = −c2 ψ/2; this is
the precise content of “emergent time” and fixes normalization. (ii) We supply a constrained,
monotone family µα (x) with convex energy density and show existence/uniqueness (static) by direct variational methods, yielding well-posed compact profiles, photon spheres, and optical horizons
(with causal meaning via the optical metric). (iii) We add a minimal massless TT sector at speed
c and derive the quadrupole flux from an action with universal effective stress coupling; deviations
are parameterized and mapped to ppE phase coefficients with explicit formulae. Quantitatively,
we present (a) an EHT shadow pipeline based on the extremum of n(r)r and (b) a ppE dictionary {ε0 , ε2 , φ3 } → {β−5 , β−3 , β−2 } for catalog fits. The laboratory discriminator —a co-located
cavity–atom ratio across altitude—is derived in the main text (not relegated), with required dispersion/elastic controls. We discuss EFT/quantum consistency at low energies and outline cosmological
consequences to the extent they are falsifiable.

solar limit µ → 1; (ii) deep-field branch µ(x) ∼ x; (iii)
monotonicity µ′ (x) > 0 for ellipticity; (iv) convex W

This encodes a one-parameter departure from the minimal λ = 1 case and will be used for EHT/ppE fits.

Optical causal structure. The optical metric (1) supplies causal meaning: optical horizons are loci where
n → ∞ (c1 → 0), forbidding outward null escape. We
stress that this is an optical horizon; its global structure
need not coincide with GR event horizons, and this difference is observationally testable via photon rings.

QUANTUM/EFT AND COSMOLOGY
(SCOPE AND FALSIFIABILITY)

Low-energy
EFT
consistency. At
laboratory/astrophysical energies, DFD acts as a classical
medium theory with an optical metric for light and a
conservative potential for matter. Quantization of hij
follows the standard free massless TT field. The ψ field
need not be canonically quantized to confront current
phenomenology; loop corrections would renormalize
W (hence µ), providing a natural origin for crossover
behavior (cf. induced-gravity heuristics). Observable
constraints enter via §IV.
Cosmology (claim limited to a testable bias). Rather
than assert “no dark energy,” we make a narrower, falsifiable statement: optical path-length bias from n = eψ
induces a line-of-sight selection in local distance ladders,
shifting inferred H0 anisotropically. The smoking gun is

4
a correlation between δH0 (n̂) and LOS density-gradient
proxies. This is testable with existing ladder data without re-deriving FRW dynamics here.

VII.

DISCUSSION

Direct methods (coercivity, weak lower semicontinuity)
yield a minimizer ψ ∈ H 1 (Ω) for bounded Ω and admissible boundary data. The Euler–Lagrange equation is
(4). Maximum principles and Schauder estimates ensure
regularity; uniqueness follows from strict convexity of W .
These establish well-posedness of static compact profiles.
Appendix D: Quadrupole Flux

We addressed “why this theory” by elevating the optical postulates to a minimal equivalence principle tied
to the eikonal of the optical metric; we justified the
scalar–tensor radiation sector by an action with universal effective stress coupling; we replaced ad hoc µ with a
constrained family admitting PDE existence/uniqueness
and yielding quantitative shadow predictions; we moved
the decisive LPI derivation into the main text; and we
provided fit-ready ppE formulae. The remaining work
is empirical: (i) fit (α, λ, a⋆ ) to EHT shadow radii with
priors; (ii) translate catalog ppE bounds into (ε0 , ε2 , φ3 );
(iii) run the sector-resolved LPI test with dual-λ and elastic controls. Any of these can falsify the sector presented
here.

Compute the Noether stress tensor for (11), project
TT, and evaluate the far-zone flux, obtaining (14). The
source multipoles coincide with GR at leading PN order because the conservative dynamics are Newtonian in
Φ = −c2 ψ/2; deviations appear as (ε0 , ε2 ) in the binding
energy and φ3 in the radiative efficiency.

Appendix E: ppE Dictionary

Starting from dE/dt = −F, expand (15)–(16) to first
order and integrate in stationary phase. One recovers
(18)–(20) with

Appendix A: Dimensions and Normalizations

ψ is dimensionless; [a⋆ ] = m s−2 , [ρ] = kg m−3 . The
Lagrangian density in (3) has units J m−3 ; variation
yields (4) with 8πG/c2 ensuring the Newtonian and optical normalizations that reproduce GR’s classic tests.

+ η,

D3 (η) = −16π,

the standard GR weights for 1PN conservative and 1.5PN
dissipative terms. This enables direct translation of catalog bounds into DFD parameters.

Appendix B: Wave → Ray: Optical Metric and
Eikonal
Appendix F: Shadow Worked Example

Starting from Maxwell in a slowly varying dielectric, one obtains the Gordon optical metric; the
eikonal/Hamilton–Jacobi equations yield rays as null
geodesics of (1). This legitimizes using (7) in strong gradients (standard references in the bibliography).

For a given (α, λ, a⋆ ), integrate (6) outward from R⋆
with boundary data matching the solar normalization at
large r. Solve d[n(r)r]/dr = 0 for rph and evaluate bcrit =
n(rph )rph . Compare θsh = bcrit /Do to EHT; use (10) for
sensitivity. This provides concrete posteriors on (α, λ)
independent of galaxy data.
