We propose a co-located, two-height comparison of a solid-state length standard (evacuated optical cavity) against atomic frequency standards to test local position invariance (LPI). In general
relativity (GR) all clocks redshift by ∆f /f = ∆Φ/c2 ; therefore the co-transport ratio R = fcav /fat
must be invariant (∆R/R = 0). We introduce a sector-resolved parameterization in which the cavity
and atomic redshifts are

for which the four measured slopes obey
ξ (ULE,Sr) = δtot ,
ξ (ULE,Yb) = δtot − δat ,
ξ (Si,Sr) = δtot − δL ,
ξ (Si,Yb) = δtot − δL − δat .
This over-determined 4→3 system is solved by generalized least squares (GLS) with full covariance, separating solid-state length, atomic-structure, and residual wave-propagation responses.
We specify metrology-grade geopotential determination (beyond g∆h), elastic-sag modeling with
an orientation-flip control, dual-wavelength dispersion and thermo-optic bounds, and a quantitative noise/systematics budget yielding projected 68/95% confidence intervals on (δtot , δL , δat ) for
∆h = 30–100 m.
I.

Motivation and context

The Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) asserts that
non-gravitational clocks share the same fractional gravitational redshift [1]. Optical clocks have verified redshift over mm–km scales [2–4]; cavity tests constrain LLI
at 10−18 [5–7]; matter-wave interferometry probes related aspects [8–11]; composition-dependent tests bound
WEP violations [12–14]. Yet a co-located redshift comparison between a solid-state length standard and atomic
standards across a vertical potential change has not set
sector-resolved bounds at ≲ 10−16 . Our goal is to provide
that sector resolution with a minimal, over-determined
design.

Identifiable sector parameters and GR limit

fore report (δtot , δL , δat ) as defined above. The linear system for ξ = {ξ (ULE,Sr) , ξ (ULE,Yb) , ξ (Si,Sr) , ξ (Si,Yb) }⊤ and
δ = {δtot , δL , δat }⊤ is

ξ = B δ,

GLS estimator and covariance

With slope covariance Cξ (from repeated cycles including configuration-dependent nuisance parameters), the
GLS solution and parameter covariance are

We adopt the GR normalization αw = 1, αL

0, αat = 1, so the cavity behaves as any clock in GR
and ∆R/R = 0. Because adding a common offset to

} leaves slopes invariant, only three combinations are identifiable. We there-

FIG. 1. At each height, PDH-locked cavity lasers (two materials/builds) and co-located Sr and Yb clocks are compared
by a comb to form four ratios R(M,S) . Two stationary windows (bottom/top) per cycle give four slopes ξ (M,S) , which
determine (δtot , δL , δat ) via GLS with full covariance.

III.

Experimental concept and cadence

Two evacuated cavities (ULE at RT; Si cryogenic or
a second ULE with distinct geometry/coatings) provide
(M )
fcav via PDH. Co-located Sr and Yb optical clocks pro(S)
vide fat . A self-referenced comb measures the four ra(M,S)
tios R
simultaneously. The apparatus measures at
two heights ∆h = 30–100 m; no data are taken during
motion. Each cycle uses two stationary windows (bottom/top). Per-slope estimates are the ratio differences
divided by the metrology-grade ∆Φ/c2 (Sec. IV).
IV.

Geodesy and potential modeling

We determine ∆Φ with geodetic methods, not g∆h
approximations. Heights are tied by differential leveling
(or laser trackers) referenced to benchmarks with geoid
models; local gravity is measured by relative gravimeters; solid Earth/ocean tides, atmospheric loading, and
polar motion corrections are applied for the measurement
epochs; the geopotential number difference is converted
to ∆Φ with uncertainties (few ×10−18 fractional over
30–100 m is routine in chronometric geodesy). The ∆Φ
uncertainty enters the slope covariance Cξ as a multiplicative error common to all four slopes.
V.

Cavity mechanics under transport

Vertical relocation changes load paths, tilt, and gravity
gradient; supports can induce elastic sag independent of
redshift. We bound this with:
• Elastic model: Treat spacer as a beam of length
L, modulus E, second moment I, effective weight
W , with support spacing optimized to null firstorder sag. The static deflection δL ∼ κ W L3 /(EI)
(geometry-dependent κ ≪ 1); we target |δL|/L <
3 × 10−16 per window, verified at both heights.
• Orientation flip: Rotate each cavity by 180◦

Dual-wavelength check and dispersion bound

Each cavity is probed at two wavelengths λ1 , λ2 separated by ≳ 50 nm within the low-loss band (e.g.,
698/1064 nm or 934/1064 nm). Residual mirror-coating
dispersion and thermo-refractive effects can bias the inferred slope. A first-order bound gives

|∆ξdisp | ≲

using measured ∂n/∂T , coating dispersion, and window

|ξλ1 − ξλ2 | < 0.1 |ξ|targ

and

< 2σ∆ ,

so dispersion/thermo-optic bias contributes ≤ 10% of a
per-slope target and ≲ 2% in the GLS solution (typical
cond(B) ∼ O(1)). Polarization is fixed and monitored;
birefringence is bounded with a polarization-swap control.
VII.

Environmental thresholds and hardware swaps

Stationary windows: locks re-acquired; platform
acceleration RMS < 10−3 g (1–100 Hz); linear drift
< 3 × 10−15 per 300 s with R2 > 0.98; pod temperature stability < 10 mK; pressure stability < 10−2 mbar;
magnetic field drift < 10 µT with reversal every other
window. Swaps: Every K=4 cycles (or ∼1 h), swap
mirror sets/mount orientation, interchange Sr/Yb comb
feeds, and permute detection electronics. Configuration
offsets {δc } are profiled; induced correlations are encoded
in Cξ .
VIII.

Noise and systematics budget

We model the ratio Allan variance as σy2 (τ ) = h−1 /τ +
h0 +h+1 τ (white-FM, flicker-FM, random-walk-FM). Table I lists representative per-window contributions for 300
s windows; common-mode terms are handled in Cξ .
For ∆h = 100 m, (g∆h/c2 ) = 1.09 × 10−14 . A perslope target sensitivity |ξ|targ ∼ 0.05 is reachable in tens
of minutes under the conservative envelope; GLS then
yields projected 68/95% CIs on (δtot , δL , δat ). A simulated corner plot (Supplemental) shows expected contours from mock ξ and full Cξ .
IX.

Practical implementation choices

A cryogenic Si cavity is attractive but not essential. A fully room-temperature 2×2 using two ULE
builds (different geometry/coatings) suffices to determine

The sector-resolved, over-determined cavity–atom
comparison isolates solid-state length, atomic-structure,
and wave-propagation redshift responses and provides
clean, co-located LPI/UCR tests across 30–100 m height
differences. The corrected GR limit, identifiable δ-basis,
metrology-grade geodesy, elastic-sag controls, and quantitative noise/systematics budget establish this as a rigorous experimental framework; with initial data setting
competitive bounds, it would naturally transition to a
full GR test.

Reporting and interpretation

Primary results are the four slopes with full covariance
and the GLS estimates δ̂ with Cδ , reported as 68/95%
CIs. GR corresponds to δ = 0. We recommend reporting
in the δ-basis; SME mappings are model-dependent and

Conclusions

Note on SME context

Isotropic SME combinations affecting photon propagation and matter sectors can be related qualitatively
to (δtot , δL , δat ). Because mappings depend on material
and atomic structure, we report bounds primarily in the
δ-basis and defer coefficient extraction to future, systemspecific work.
