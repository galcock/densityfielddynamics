Density Field Dynamics Resolves the Penrose Superposition Paradox
Gary Alcock
Independent Researcher, Los Angeles, CA, USA
(Dated: September 19, 2025)
Penrose has argued that a quantum superposition of mass distributions leads to a structural inconsistency: in general relativity, each branch would source a distinct spacetime geometry, whereas
quantum mechanics allows only a single state until collapse. We show that Density Field Dynamics (DFD), a scalar-field completion of Einstein’s 1911–12 variable-c program, avoids this paradox
entirely. In DFD there is no manifold branching: superposed mass distributions source a single
2
classical (c-number) refractive field ψ, which governs both light (n = eψ ) and matter (a = c2 ∇ψ).
In the weak-field linear regime (µ → 1), ψ is the convex sum of the branch fields; in the full quasilinear regime, monotonicity of the crossover function µ ensures existence and uniqueness of a single
solution. Thus DFD is structurally compatible with quantum superposition, unlike GR, and the
decisive discriminator remains laboratory testability: the co-located cavity–atom redshift comparison at two altitudes, where GR predicts zero slope and DFD predicts a geometry-locked slope of
O(∆Φ/c2 ) ∼ 10−14 per 100 m.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Penrose has long emphasized a tension between general relativity (GR) and quantum mechanics (QM) [1, 2]. If
a macroscopic object is placed in spatial superposition, GR demands that each branch source its own spacetime
curvature, while QM maintains only a single quantum state until measurement. This “two spacetimes vs. one Hilbert
space” contradiction underpins Penrose’s proposal that gravity induces wavefunction collapse.
Density Field Dynamics (DFD) [13–15] replaces curved spacetime with a single classical (c-number) scalar refractive

field ψ(x). Photons propagate with index n = eψ , matter accelerates as a = c2 ∇ψ, and ψ obeys the quasilinear elliptic

with µ → 1 in the weak-field regime (and a⋆ the characteristic deep-field acceleration scale). Normalization reproduces
GR’s weak-field optical tests [3], while the µ-family enforces scale symmetry, ellipticity, and convex energy density [9].

SUPERPOSITION SOURCES IN DFD

Let the quantum state of a mass distribution be |Ψ⟩, with density operator ρ̂(x). The effective source entering (1)
is the expectation value
ρeff (x) = ⟨Ψ|ρ̂(x)|Ψ⟩.

(2)

For a superposition of two localized packets |L⟩, |R⟩ with |Ψ⟩ = a|L⟩ + b|R⟩,
ρeff ≃ |a|2 ρL + |b|2 ρR + 2 Re(a∗ b ρLR ) ,

(3)

where the interference term ρLR is exponentially suppressed for well-separated packets. In the linear (Poisson) regime
(µ → 1), the field solution is
ψ ≃ |a|2 ψL + |b|2 ψR ,

(4)

a convex sum of branch fields. In the full nonlinear regime, monotone µ ensures uniform ellipticity; existence and
uniqueness follow by variational methods (Sec. VII). Thus there is always a single ψ field—a weighted combination
of branch contributions—ensuring no manifold branching.
A.

Semiclassical sourcing (but not semiclassical GR)

DFD sources a classical scalar field ψ by ρeff = ⟨ρ̂⟩, yet the geometry is never promoted to an operator; there is
no ĝ. This is not the semiclassical Einstein equation Gµν = 8πG⟨T̂µν ⟩. Instead, the optical metric for light is n = eψ

arises, and Penrose’s paradox does not materialize.

B.

Linear vs. Nonlinear Regimes

DFD’s µ(x) crossover unifies two limits with a single PDE and a single ψ: (i) the high-gradient (solar-system) regime
µ → 1, where the equation reduces to a linear Poisson problem; and (ii) the deep-field (galactic) regime µ(x) ∼ x,
which yields scale-free behavior |∇ψ| ∝ 1/r and flat rotation curves. In both regimes ψ is a classical field determined
by ρeff ; no operator-valued geometry arises.
C.

Worked example: superposed grain of sand

Consider m ∼ 10−7 kg in a spatial superposition with branch centers separated by d ∼ 1 µm. In GR, two geometries
are implicated. In DFD, ρeff ≈ 12 (ρL + ρR ) and the weak-field solution is ψ = 12 (ψL + ψR ) by (4). The acceleration
field a = (c2 /2)∇ψ and optical index n = eψ are single-valued; no paradox arises.

LABORATORY DISCRIMINATOR

While the theoretical resolution is complete, experimental verification remains the decisive test of which theory
nature follows. In a nondispersive band, an evacuated cavity with frequency fcav ∝ c1 /L and a co-located atomic
clock fat respond differently to ψ. Across an altitude change ∆h,

In GR, ξ = 0; in DFD, ξ ≃ 1 [18]. For Earth’s surface,

This level is achievable with state-of-the-art optical metrology [7, 8]. Matter-wave interferometry provides a second
discriminator: DFD predicts a T 3 phase scaling in long-baseline atom interferometers, yielding a ∼ 2 × 10−11 rad
signal at T = 1 s, within reach of current facilities [17].

DISCUSSION

Collapse models (GRW/CSL) vs. DFD

GRW and CSL add stochastic, non-unitary collapse terms to resolve the GR/QM tension [6]. DFD requires no
such postulates: the background is a classical c-number field ψ, so there is never more than one geometry to begin
with. Penrose’s structural paradox is absent without modifying the Schrödinger equation stochastically.

B.

Decoherence vs. DFD

Environmental decoherence suppresses interference but does not remove the two-geometry issue in GR. DFD never
produces branch geometries: superposed sources create one ψ fixed by ρeff . Thus decoherence is relevant to experimental visibility, not to resolving a structural inconsistency.

C.

Cosmological implications

The same optical-metric mechanism impacts cosmography: line-of-sight inhomogeneities bias optical distances,
inducing a directional H0 anisotropy tied to ψ-weighted density gradients [13]. This links laboratory falsification to
large-scale observables.

WELL-POSEDNESS (EXISTENCE & UNIQUENESS)

Theorem (well-posedness). Let µ : R+ → R+ be continuous, monotone increasing, and satisfy 0 < µmin ≤ µ(·) ≤
µmax < ∞ on compact subdomains of interest. Given ρ ∈ L2loc and suitable boundary conditions, Eq. (1) admits a

c2 ψ(ρ − ρ̄) with F (y) = µ(y/a⋆ )y. Monotonicity of
µ implies convexity of F and coercivity on appropriate Sobolev spaces. The direct method of the calculus of variations
yields a minimizer; uniqueness follows from strict convexity [9]. For µ → 1 one recovers the linear Poisson theory; for
µ ∼ x deep-field scaling holds.

VIII.

CONCLUSION

Penrose’s paradox arises only if mass superpositions imply multiple geometries. In DFD, superpositions source one
classical ψ field, ensuring consistency with quantum mechanics. The debate moves from philosophy to experiment:
a co-located cavity–atom comparison at two altitudes, together with matter-wave interferometry, can decide between
GR and DFD with current precision.

Using ∇ · (f A) = f ∇ · A + ∇f · A and rearranging gives ∂t |Ψ|2 + ∇ · J = 0 with J as in (6). Writing the kinetic

operator as 2m
p̂ψ with p̂ψ = −iℏe−ψ/2 ∇e−ψ/2 shows self-adjointness on the natural domain (Dirichlet/Neumann for
bounded regions; L2 decay at infinity).

Appendix B: Existence/Uniqueness (variational details)

Let A(ψ) = ∇· (µ(|∇ψ|/a⋆ )∇ψ). Assuming µ monotone and bounded away from zero, A is uniformly elliptic. The
functional E[ψ] is convex and coercive, admitting a minimizer; Gateaux differentiability yields (1) in weak form; strict
convexity implies uniqueness [9].
