Parametrized Post-Newtonian Analysis of Density Field Dynamics
in the Weak-Field, Slow-Motion Limit
Gary Alcock
September, 2025
Abstract
We present a complete mapping of Density Field Dynamics (DFD) to the ten standard
Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) coefficients {γ, β, ξ, α1,2,3 , ζ1,2,3,4 } in the weak-field, slowmotion (1PN) regime. Starting from the optical-metric ansatz g00 = −eψ , gij = e−ψ δij with ψ =
−2U/c2 +O(c−4 ), we derive γ = β = 1 from the scalar sector. We then solve the vector sector
via

a transverse (Helmholtz) projection of the mass current to obtain g0i = c13 − 72 Vi − 12 Wi , which
implies α1,2,3 = ξ = ζ1 = 0 at 1PN. Completing g00 at O(c−4 ) shows no Whitehead term (ξ = 0),
and diffeomorphism invariance with minimal coupling gives local conservation, ζ1,2,3,4 = 0. Thus
DFD reproduces all ten GR PPN values at 1PN. We provide explicit derivations and audit
checks, validate against classic observables (deflection, Shapiro, perihelion, frame-dragging),
and summarize experimental implications.

Introduction

The Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism provides the standard language for comparing
metric theories of gravity in the Solar System regime [1,2]. Its ten parameters {γ, β, ξ, α1,2,3 , ζ1,2,3,4 }
encode spatial curvature, nonlinear superposition, preferred-frame/location effects, and possible
non-conservation. General Relativity (GR) predicts γ = β = 1 and all others zero, in agreement
with stringent bounds from time-delay (Cassini) [3], Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) [4], and pulsars [5].
Density Field Dynamics (DFD) is a refractive-index based framework in which an exponential index
n = eψ induces an optical metric. Here we show that, in the nondispersive band and to 1PN order,
DFD’s PPN predictions are identical to GR across all ten parameters. Beyond 1PN, discriminators
naturally move to precision metrology and strong-field dynamics.

Vector Sector: Shift from Helmholtz Projection

Introduce a shift Ni :

To 1PN, impose the transverse gauge ∂i Ni = 0 (isotropic PPN gauge). Let ji = ρvi and ji⊥ =
(δij − ∂i ∂j ∇−2 )jj denote the divergence-free current. The weak-field vector equation reduces to a
Poisson problem
∇2 Ni = −16πG ji⊥ .

hence dV + dW = −4. Equation (17) satisfies this identically.

Conservation and the ζ Parameters

In the nondispersive band, DFD is a metric theory with diffeomorphism invariance and minimal
matter coupling to the effective metric (9). By the contracted Bianchi identity, this implies local
covariant conservation of total stress–energy at 1PN, yielding
ζ2 = ζ3 = ζ4 = 0 .
Combined with (18), all four ζ parameters vanish.

Validation Against Classic Tests

Light deflection and Shapiro delay. With γ = 1, the grazing-Sun deflection is ∆θ = 4GM/(c2 b)
and the two-way time delay is ∆t = (2GM/c3 ) ln(4rE rR /b2 ), consistent with Cassini [3].

Perihelion advance. With β = γ = 1, the advance per revolution is ∆ϖ = 6πGM/(c2 a(1 − e2 )),
matching observations [1].
Frame-dragging proxy. In the far zone of a rigid rotator Wi ≃ Vi , so (17) gives g0i ≃ −4Vi /c3 ,
consistent with Lense–Thirring phenomenology [6, 7].

Discussion

DFD’s exact match to GR across all ten PPN parameters ensures compatibility with Solar System
and binary pulsar tests at 1PN order. This shifts decisive experimental discriminators to regimes
beyond the PPN formalism:
• Local Position Invariance (LPI) and frequency-sector comparisons (e.g., cavity–atom comparisons; atom interferometry) [8, 9].
• Strong-field gravitational-wave signals and horizon-scale optics [10].
Dispersion and the PPN Analysis
Outside the nondispersive band, a weak frequency dependence of n = eψ would induce higher-order
dispersion corrections. These manifest as frequency-dependent distortions of light propagation
(apparent shifts in effective γ for traced rays) and tiny anisotropies in Shapiro delay. Given current
broadband tests, any such effects are expected to be extremely small; precision cavity and comb
interferometry are the natural probes.
Strong-Field Discriminators: Gravitational Waves and Black Holes
Since DFD reproduces GR at 1PN, deviations must appear at higher PN orders or in strong gravity.
A different saturation of the effective index near compact objects would adjust quasi-normal mode
spectra and late-inspiral phasing at relative v 6 /c6 . These are below current ground-based sensitivity
but are targets for LISA/Cosmic Explorer. A dedicated waveform model is a natural next step.
Refractive-Index Interpretation and Quantum Aspects
The refractive picture connects naturally to analog systems where effective light speed depends
on background density. This suggests routes to quantum tests (e.g., single-particle interferometry
with engineered indices), and may simplify semiclassical back-reaction modeling relative to purely
geometric curvature descriptions.

Future Work

1. Publish the full derivation of (16) and (17) with explicit operator identities and gauge-fixing,
enabling independent reproduction.

2. Extend beyond 1PN: quantify dispersive corrections and develop strong-field waveform models
for black-hole spectroscopy.
3. Provide a public numerical notebook (symbolic + finite-difference) reproducing the PPN
coefficients from arbitrary matter sources.

Matching U and U 2 terms yields γ = 1, β = 1 (12). The matter+field bookkeeping at O(c−4 )
produces the standard GR combination of {Φ1 , Φ2 , Φ3 , Φ4 } and no ΦW contribution, hence sW =
0 ⇒ ξ = 0 in (13).

where the factors − 72 and − 12 arise from matching to the isotropic-gauge PPN form with γ = 1
(see (3)). Equation (24) implies α1,2,3 = ζ1 = ξ = 0.
Gauge and near/far-zone checks. (i) The result is gauge-clean because gradients have been
removed by the transverse projector. (ii) Far-zone check: for a rigid rotator Wi ≃ Vi so dV + dW =
−4 is satisfied. (iii) Near-zone corrections distinguish Vi and Wi but do not change the coefficients
in (24) at 1PN.

C

Conservation and ζ1,2,3,4 = 0

In a metric theory with diffeomorphism invariance and minimally coupled matter, the Bianchi
identity enforces local conservation T µν ;ν = 0 to the relevant PN order. Therefore, the PPN
parameters controlling violations of momentum/energy conservation vanish: ζ1 = ζ2 = ζ3 = ζ4 = 0.
This holds in DFD’s nondispersive band because the dynamics is entirely encoded in the effective
metric (9) with the same matter closure used to define U , Vi , Wi , and the Φ’s.

D

Observable Cross-Checks (Compact)

Deflection: ∆θ = 4GM/(c2 b) follows from null geodesics with γ = 1. Shapiro: ∆t = (2GM/c3 ) ln(4rE rR /b2 ).
Perihelion: ∆ϖ = 6πGM/(c2 a(1 − e2 )) for β = γ = 1. Frame-drag proxy: g0i ≃ −4Vi /c3 in
the far zone of a rotator.
