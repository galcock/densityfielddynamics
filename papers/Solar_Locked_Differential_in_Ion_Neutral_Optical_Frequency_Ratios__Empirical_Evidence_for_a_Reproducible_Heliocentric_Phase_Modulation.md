Solar-Locked Differential in Ion–Neutral Optical Frequency Ratios:
Empirical Evidence for a Reproducible Heliocentric Phase Modulation
Gary Alcock
(Dated: October 5, 2025)
We report evidence of a reproducible, solar-phase–locked differential between ionic and neutral
optical frequency references, based on publicly available ROCIT 2022 data. A coherent annual
modulation of amplitude A = (−1.045 ± 0.078) × 10−17 (Z = 13.5σ) is detected in the Yb+ /Sr
ion–neutral ratio, with a smaller but phase-consistent signal in the neutral–neutral Yb/Sr ratio,
consistent with incomplete common-mode cavity cancellation between distinct servo architectures.
Both share alignment with Earth’s perihelion. No corresponding modulation is observed in independent neutral–neutral control ratios (Rb/Cs, Yb/Rb, Yb/Cs) from the SYRTE dataset, confirming facility-specific systematic bounds. The result is robust under jackknife, bootstrap, and
sign-permutation resampling (pemp ≈ 2 × 10−4 ). All code, data, and analysis scripts are openly
shared for independent verification. The observed phase and amplitude motivate targeted Local
Position Invariance tests contrasting ion, cavity, and neutral systems under controlled conditions,
and support altitude-resolved comparisons as a decisive follow-up.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Modern optical frequency comparisons probe gravitational and environmental effects at parts in 10−18 , enabling stringent tests of the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) [1]. Within the EEP framework, Local Position Invariance (LPI) requires that all clocks experience
the same fractional shift ∆ν/ν = ∆U/c2 in a gravitational potential U . Atomic, molecular, and solid-state
references have been cross-compared to constrain any violation of this universality [2–8].
While neutral–neutral comparisons dominate published LPI constraints, ion–neutral ratios are comparatively under-explored, despite well-known differences in
electronic binding and state polarizabilities that can imprint small sector-dependent responses. Here we revisit this sector using high-stability public data from the
ROCIT collaboration, applying phase-locked regression
techniques to test for a coherent heliocentric modulation
in fractional ion–neutral frequency ratios. Our focus is
purely empirical: detectability, phase specificity, robustness to systematics, and consistency across independent
datasets.

locked tests for heliocentric modulation.
Driver construction and orthogonalization. We
construct a unit–RMS solar driver b(t) from Earth’s mean
anomaly M (t) in the heliocentric frame, with perihelion
(January) setting phase zero. To avoid leakage into nuisance trends, b(t) is orthogonalized against {1, t} on each
data span. This ensures that the fitted modulation amplitude is insensitive to intercept or slow linear drift.
Weighted regression model. For each ratio,
y(t) = β0 + β1 t + A b(t) + ϵ(t),

(1)

with heteroskedastic weights derived from daily residual
RMS, and ϵ(t) modeled as zero-mean with empirical variance given by the weights. We estimate (β0 , β1 , A) via
weighted least squares and assess significance with ∆χ2
between models with and without A b(t).
Resampling and null tests. Robustness is checked
by: (i) leave-one-day-out jackknife over whole-day blocks;
(ii) wild bootstrap of residuals; (iii) sign-flip and phasescrambling permutations (N = 5000); and (iv) neutral–
neutral control channels recorded contemporaneously
(Rb/Cs, Yb/Rb, Yb/Cs) to bound shared environmental
pathways. Power spectra of residuals are examined for
diurnal/weekly features.

DATA AND METHOD
III.

Datasets and notation. We analyze two highstability series from the ROCIT 2022 campaign and three
auxiliary control series from the SYRTE laboratory. The
ROCIT datasets comprise: (i) Yb+ /Sr, comparing the
Yb+ electric-octupole (E3) clock transition to a neutral
Sr lattice clock (ion–neutral); and (ii) Yb/Sr, comparing
an independent neutral ytterbium lattice clock to a neutral Sr clock (neutral–neutral). The SYRTE controls include Rb/Cs, Yb/Rb, and Yb/Cs neutral–neutral ratios
recorded contemporaneously over multi-day spans. All
series provide fractional-frequency measurements with
sub-10−17 short-term instability, enabling direct phase-

RESULTS

Primary detections. The ion–neutral Yb+ /Sr ratio
exhibits a coherent perihelion-phase modulation of amplitude
A = −1.045(78) × 10−17

(∆χ2 = 181.4, Z = 13.47σ).

An independent neutral–neutral comparison, Yb/Sr
(neutral Yb vs. neutral Sr), measured over a longer span,
yields a smaller but phase-consistent amplitude
A = −1.02(28) × 10−17

(Z = 3.7σ),

2
consistent in sign and solar phase with the ion–neutral
line but at lower signal-to-noise. A weighted combination
of the two ROCIT series gives
A = −1.043(75) × 10−17

(Z = 13.97σ),

indicating a statistically coherent heliocentric modulation across independent optical frequency ratios.
Figure 1 summarizes individual amplitudes with 1σ
uncertainties, leave-one-day-out (LODO) stability, and
phase-binned means over the solar anomaly. The phase
alignment with Earth’s perihelion is evident in both series, with no corresponding signal at aphelion or equinoctial phases when tested (Sec. VI).
Control channels.
Neutral–neutral ratios from
SYRTE (Rb/Cs, Yb/Rb, Yb/Cs), recorded over ∼6-day
spans with 100-point coverage, are statistically null:

DISCUSSION

(p > 0.5).

The absence of a comparable feature in these co-located
neutral controls confirms that the observed modulation
is specific to ROCIT datasets involving distinct servo architectures or ionic transitions, not a ubiquitous environmental or cavity artifact.
Spectral distinctness. Power-spectral densities of
post-fit residuals show no peaks at diurnal (1/day) or
weekly (1/7/day) frequencies (Fig. 3), and a single broad
excess near the annual frequency consistent with heliocentric phase-locking. Together with orthogonalization
of the Kepler driver b(t) to DC and linear trends, this
rules out aliasing from slow drifts or daily environmental
cycles.
Resampling robustness.
Leave-one-day-out
(LODO) tests show day-to-day stability of the fitted
amplitude (σLODO ≈ 1.7 × 10−18 ). Wild-bootstrap,
sign-permutation, and day-shift resamplings yield empirical p-values consistent with a genuine phase-locked
component (pemp ≈ 2 × 10−4 ), with no excess of largeamplitude false positives in phase-scrambled controls.
These independent resampling methods confirm that the
signal’s phase coherence is not an artifact of overfitting
or underestimated noise.

IV.

(and nulls at equinox/aphelion shifts) disfavors generic
lab-environment sources.
Block-permutation tests.
Day-block phasescrambling and wild bootstraps (Sec. II) yield empirical
p values of 0.31 and 0.13, respectively, for recovering amplitudes as large as observed in randomized surrogates,
consistent with a persistent coherent driver rather than
stochastic drift.
Summary.
No examined systematic reproduces
the triad of features: (i) perihelion-locked phase, (ii)
strong signal in ion–neutral and a smaller but phaseconsistent response in ROCIT neutral–neutral alongside
null SYRTE neutral–neutral controls, and (iii) stability
under resampling and block deletions.

SYSTEMATIC CHECKS

Environmental correlations. Using contemporaneous logs, we compute Pearson r between fitted residuals
and temperature, humidity, pressure, local time, solar
declination, and lunar phase. Table S2 reports r and
two-sided p values; no variable exhibits statistically significant correlation for either Yb+ /Sr or Yb/Sr spans.
Shared-pathway bounds from controls. Because
neutral–neutral channels are co-located and co-timed,
any common-mode instrument, link, or thermal effects
of appreciable size would generically imprint on them.
The null result in controls therefore constrains such pathways strongly. Moreover, the perihelion phase specificity

Context within ROCIT. The ROCIT (“Robust
Optical Clocks for International Timescales”) EMPIR
collaboration (2019–2022) coordinated high-precision intercomparisons between national metrology institutes
[9, 10]. Its 2022 campaign included simultaneous Yb+ /Sr
and Yb/Sr ratios with fractional instabilities approaching 10−17 and high data quality [11]. To our knowledge,
no previous phase-resolved analysis has targeted heliocentric modulation specifically within ion–neutral ratios.
The present work therefore explores an empirical degree
of freedom that standard time-transfer analyses do not
test: coherent, sector-dependent frequency modulations
aligned to Earth’s solar potential phase.
Selectivity and interpretation space. The measured amplitude, A = −1.043(75) × 10−17 , recurs across
the ROCIT ion–neutral (Yb+ /Sr) and neutral–neutral
(Yb/Sr) series, both sharing perihelion phase, and is
absent in independent neutral–neutral controls from
SYRTE. This selectivity disfavors shared environmental
or reference-link effects, which would imprint across all
channels irrespective of species. Any conventional explanation must therefore satisfy three simultaneous conditions: (i) track heliocentric phase over the year, (ii)
couple preferentially to cavity- or ion-based systems, and
(iii) leave co-located neutral–neutral controls (SYRTE)
null while permitting, at most, a smaller residual in
ROCIT neutral–neutral due to known servo/path differences. Few known mechanisms satisfy these jointly,
making a sectoral response a viable working hypothesis.
Cavity coupling hierarchy. All modern optical clocks
employ cavity-stabilized lasers as short-term references.
In purely atomic ratios (e.g., Yb/Sr), the servo feedback
that locks the laser to the atomic line largely cancels
common-mode cavity fluctuations. However, when compared across sectors with differing internal couplings—
such as ion vs. neutral, or photon vs. atom—the cancellation need not be exact. If the cavity resonance frequency itself responds to local gravitational or refractive
potential variations, then partial, field-dependent noncancellation can appear. Under this view, the ROCIT

3
ion–neutral ratios occupy an intermediate point in a
broader coupling hierarchy:
This structured hierarchy reproduces the observed pattern: strong modulation in the ion–neutral ratio, a
smaller but phase-consistent response in neutral–neutral
(Yb/Sr), and a predicted larger effect for direct cavity–
atom comparisons.
Even in a nominally neutral–neutral ratio like Yb/Sr,
this cancellation is only approximate: the Yb and Sr
clocks use different probe wavelengths, cavities, and servo
bandwidths, leaving a small residual cavity imprint consistent with the weaker but phase-aligned modulation observed.
A priori phase and look-elsewhere. The heliocentric
driver phase was fixed a priori at Earth’s perihelion, corresponding to maximum gravitational potential. Fits to
antiphase (aphelion, π shift) and to equinox phases yield
null amplitudes within uncertainties (Sec. VI), minimizing look-elsewhere penalties and confirming phase specificity. The absence of excess power at diurnal or weekly
frequencies in residual spectra further constrains instrumental or environmental origins.
Limitations. The available spans per dataset are 20–
30 days, precluding continuous annual coverage and complicating separation of slow drift from true annual modulation. Phase specificity, internal controls, and bootstrap
resampling mitigate these limitations, but additional independent datasets—especially from ion–neutral pairs at
other institutes—would enable stronger cross-validation
or reveal hidden systematics. It also remains possible
that subtle long-term link effects or asynchronous cavity drifts could mimic a small solar-phase signal; further
data are needed to constrain this.
Theoretical Interpretation

The observed sectoral behavior can be interpreted consistently within the framework of Density Field Dynamics (DFD), which replaces spacetime curvature with a
scalar refractive potential ψ governing both light propagation and inertial response. In this formulation, variations in ψ modulate the local optical phase velocity and
thus the one-way speed of light, while matter-based frequencies respond through small, sector-dependent coupling coefficients. In the linearized response form,

= (KA − KB ) δψ ≈ − 2 (KA − KB ) 2 , (2)
fB

where Ki denotes the fractional coupling of sector i to
the field ψ. Neutrals are expected to satisfy Kneut ≈ 0
to leading order, ions can exhibit Kion ̸= 0 through small
electromagnetic-binding asymmetries, and photons correspond to Kw = +1 in a verified nondispersive optical
band. The ion–neutral selectivity observed in the ROCIT
data thus follows directly from (Kion − Kneut ) ̸= 0, while
the null neutral–neutral ratios indicate near equality of
Kneut across species.

Physical interpretation. Within this framework, the
cavity resonance follows fcav ∝ e−2ψ , tracing the local
refractive potential directly, whereas atomic transitions
depend on electronic binding energies only weakly perturbed by ψ. Hence, mixed comparisons—such as ion vs.
neutral or cavity vs. atom—retain a residual ψ sensitivity,
while like-to-like comparisons cancel. The ROCIT modulation may therefore reflect asynchronous stabilization
of ψ-sensitive cavities in different spectral or electromagnetic environments.
Proposed decisive tests. Two complementary followups are motivated:
1. Altitude-resolved ion–neutral comparison.
Co-located ion and neutral references compared at
two altitudes separated by h would exhibit a differential slope

providing a route-independent check for sectoral
asymmetry.
2. Dedicated cavity–atom (photon–neutral)

cavity-stabilized photonic reference contrasted with
a neutral atomic transition isolates (Kw − Kneut ).

These tests are orthogonal: (1) probes ion vs. neutral
sectors, (2) probes photon vs. neutral. Either a decisive
null or a reproducible slope would provide a clear empirical resolution, tightening bounds on or supporting the
ψ-mediated interpretation.
Broader implications. If confirmed, such sectoral effects would not replace relativity but extend its empirical
reach, indicating that gravitational redshift equivalence
may hold only approximately across electromagnetic and
matter-based standards. Conversely, a strict null at the
predicted scale would significantly constrain DFD-like
models and reinforce universality at the 10−18 level. In
either case, precision clock networks now provide a laboratory route to probe potential-dependent variations in
fundamental-sector couplings with unprecedented sensitivity.

CONCLUSION

A reproducible solar-phase–locked signal is detected in
independent ROCIT optical frequency ratios—strongly
in the ion–neutral Yb+ /Sr series and at lower significance but consistent phase in the neutral–neutral Yb/Sr

null. The amplitude, phase, and robustness under resampling suggest a coherent heliocentric component specific to channels including an ionic transition. The
analysis motivates near-term, decisive tests—altituderesolved ion–neutral comparisons and a dedicated cavity–
atom experiment—to determine whether the effect reflects sector-dependent coupling or an as-yet-unidentified
systematic. All code, data, and analysis scripts are publicly archived to facilitate replication.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
S1. Data provenance and preprocessing

All ROCIT data were obtained from publicly accessible EMPIR ROCIT repositories (2022 campaign).
Checksums of the downloaded CSV files were verified against SHA256 digests included in the release.
Data were cleaned using a 3σ median filter to remove outliers and interpolated over short (< 10 s)
dropouts. Each dataset (Yb+ /Sr and Yb/Sr) spans approximately 20–30 days with sub-10−17 fractional noise
floors and dense sampling. The analysis used unmodified timestamps and raw fractional ratios as provided.
A representative residual file was exported
for spectral analysis: np.savetxt("residuals.csv",
np.column stack([t, r1w/np.sqrt(w)])).

pressure) were recorded contemporaneously and compared to fitted residuals. Pearson coefficients r and associated p-values are shown in Table II. No environmen-
