Density Field Dynamics and the c-Field:
A Three-Dimensional, Time-Emergent Dynamics for
Gravity and Cosmology
Gary Alcock
August 18, 2025
Abstract
We formulate a dynamical alternative to curved spacetime in which the universe
is fundamentally Euclidean R3 and time is emergent. A single scalar “c-field” ψ(x)
controls the one-way speed of light via c1 (x) = c e−ψ(x) , preserving the measured twoway light speed c. Matter and photons couple to the same ψ: massive test bodies
accelerate according to

while photons follow Fermat paths in the refractive index n(x) = eψ(x) . From a local,

which fixes the weak-field normalization needed to reproduce exactly Einstein’s classical
tests (light deflection α = 4GM/(c2 b), gravitational redshift, Shapiro delay, and the
Mercury perihelion advance) [1, 2, 3]. In the low-gradient (galactic/void) regime, the
same equation yields |∇ψ| ∝ 1/r, implying v(r) → const (flat rotation curves) without
dark matter and a Tully–Fisher/RAR
scaling [4, 5, 6, 7]. On cosmic scales, line-of-sight
R
optical length Dopt = 1c eψ ds produces a foreground-dependent bias that explains
the Hubble tension and mimics cosmic acceleration without a cosmological constant
[8, 9, 10]. We present explicit derivations and conservation laws from the action, and
give falsifiable laboratory protocols (one-way-c metrology and atom interferometry) at
the 10−10 m s−2 scale [11, 12].

Then:

• Low-gradient (galaxies/voids): µ(x) ∼ x ⇒ |∇ψ| ∝ 1/r (spherical), yielding v(r) →

with C a number of order unity fixed by the chosen µ. This reproduces the observed Tully–

[9, 10].

Lorentz invariance, simultaneity, and experimental
constraints

Conventionality of one-way c. As emphasized by Reichenbach, Edwards, and others,
the one-way speed of light is not directly measurable without a simultaneity convention;
only two-way c is empirically fixed [14, 15, 16, 17]. DFD promotes the convention parameter
to a field ψ but constrains it dynamically via (4).

which is independent of the arm orientation under a rigid rotation of the apparatus if ψ is a
scalar function of the ambient mass distribution on the arm scale. Thus modern Michelson–
Morley tests (optical cavities/whispering galleries) remain null to current sensitivity [18, 19,
20]. Kennedy–Thorndike experiments (boost dependence) are likewise preserved because the
round-trip speed along a fixed arm is path-symmetric [21, 1].
Local Lorentz symmetry. Locally, light rays in the optical medium n = eψ follow null
geodesics of Gordon’s “optical metric” [13, 2]. Hence matter and light exhibit local Lorentz
symmetry with respect to that effective metric, explaining the excellent agreement of specialrelativistic kinematics and clock comparisons (Ives–Stilwell, time dilation, etc.) while allowing global one-way anisotropy tied to ψ.

GPS and time transfer. Global navigation timing enforces a synchronization convention equivalent to isotropic two-way c in the chosen Earth-centered inertial frame [22]. DFD
reproduces all round-trip observables by design; one-way anisotropy shows up only in routedependent comparisons (Sec. 7), which are not tested by standard GPS common-view protocols.
Summary. DFD is consistent with the tightest existing tests of Lorentz invariance and
light-speed isotropy because those tests are fundamentally two-way [1, 18, 19, 20]. What
is new (and falsifiable) is the prediction of nonreciprocal one-way delays between distinct
routes in the presence of ambient ∇ψ.

Discussion and Conclusion

A single scalar ψ controlling the one-way light speed unifies gravity and optics in R3 with
emergent time. From the action (3) we obtain a nonlinear Poisson law (4) whose weak-field
normalization reproduces all Einstein classic tests exactly, and whose deep-field limit yields
flat rotation curves and a Tully–Fisher/RAR scaling without dark matter. Cosmologically,
line-of-sight optical length produces a foreground-dependent H0 bias (resolving the Hubble
tension) and an acceleration scale ∼ 10−10 m s−2 without a cosmological constant. The
framework is falsifiable now via precision metrology and atom interferometry. It replaces
four-dimensional curvature with a dynamical one-way c, closes conservation by construction,
and removes the GR–QM clash by eliminating fundamental time.

A

Weak-Field Normalization and the Factor of Two

In the weak-field regime take µ → 1, so ∇2 ψ = −(8πG/c2 )ρm . For a point mass, ψ =
2GM/(c2 r) (up to a constant). Photons see n = eψ ≃ 1 + ψ = 1 + 2GM/(c2 r). The eikonal
bending formula requires ψ = −2Φ/c2 with ∇2 Φ = 4πGρm to obtain α = 4GM/(c2 b). This
fixes the unique −8πG/c2 normalization in (4); any other choice fails the Einstein factor.
